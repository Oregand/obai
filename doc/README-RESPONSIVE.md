# Mobile-First Responsive Design Implementation

This document outlines the responsive design improvements made to the OBAI application to ensure optimal user experience across all device sizes.

## Core Responsive Components

### 1. Responsive Utilities

**Location:** `/lib/responsive/utilities.ts`

A utility library with responsive breakpoints and helper functions:
- Standardized breakpoints matching Tailwind's defaults
- Helper functions for viewport detection
- Pre-defined responsive padding, margin, and typography patterns
- Responsive grid and flex layouts

### 2. Responsive Hook

**Location:** `/lib/hooks/useResponsive.ts`

A custom React hook for responsive design:
- Detects current device type (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Provides helpers for checking against breakpoints
- Updates automatically on window resize
- Can be used for conditional rendering based on screen size

### 3. Layout Components

#### ResponsiveContainer
**Location:** `/components/layout/ResponsiveContainer.tsx`

A container component that:
- Maintains consistent max-width across device sizes
- Adjusts padding responsively
- Can be used as any HTML element via the `as` prop

#### ResponsiveGrid
**Location:** `/components/layout/ResponsiveGrid.tsx`

A grid component that:
- Adapts columns based on screen size
- Customizable gap spacing for different breakpoints
- Supports full-width spans for specific items

#### ResponsiveFlex
**Location:** `/components/layout/ResponsiveFlex.tsx`

A flexible layout component that:
- Handles direction changes at different breakpoints
- Manages alignment and spacing responsively
- Supports both row and column layouts

## Page Layouts

### 1. Chat Interface

**Location:** `/components/chat/ResponsiveChatLayout.tsx`

A responsive chat layout that:
- Shows/hides sidebar based on screen size
- Provides collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Adjusts layout for optimal space usage on small screens

### 2. Page Layout

**Location:** `/components/layout/ResponsivePageLayout.tsx`

A general page layout that:
- Converts vertical navigation to horizontal tabs on mobile
- Properly spaces content based on device size
- Handles breadcrumbs visibility responsively

## UI Components

### 1. Navigation

**Location:** `/components/navigation/ResponsiveNavbar.tsx`

A responsive navigation bar that:
- Collapses to hamburger menu on mobile
- Shows/hides specific links based on device type
- Handles mobile overlay and animations

### 2. Hero Section

**Location:** `/components/home/ResponsiveHero.tsx`

A responsive hero component that:
- Stacks content on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- Adjusts image size and visibility based on available space
- Maintains readability on all devices

### 3. Feature Grid

**Location:** `/components/home/ResponsiveFeatureGrid.tsx`

A feature showcase that:
- Adjusts columns based on screen size (1 on mobile, 2-3 on larger screens)
- Maintains consistent spacing and proportions

### 4. Message Components

**Location:** `/components/chat/ResponsiveMessage.tsx`

Chat message bubbles that:
- Adjust width and padding based on screen size
- Handle action menus differently on touch vs mouse devices
- Ensure readability on all screen sizes

### 5. Message Input

**Location:** `/components/chat/ResponsiveMessageInput.tsx`

A chat input component that:
- Auto-resizes based on content
- Adapts for touch input on mobile
- Shows/hides additional controls based on available space

### 6. Card Component

**Location:** `/components/ui/ResponsiveCard.tsx`

A multi-purpose card component that:
- Adjusts padding and layout based on screen size
- Handles content, headers, and footers responsively
- Supports hover states for desktop and touch for mobile

### 7. Form Components

**Location:** `/components/forms/ResponsiveForm.tsx`

A comprehensive form system that:
- Changes layout based on device (stacked on mobile, grid on desktop)
- Properly sizes inputs for touch targets
- Handles validation errors responsively

## Implementation Guidelines

### Mobile-First Approach

All components are built with a mobile-first approach, meaning:
1. Base styles are designed for mobile devices
2. Media queries are used to enhance layouts for larger screens
3. Touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44Ã—44px)
4. Layouts stack vertically on small screens

### Responsive Patterns

Common responsive patterns implemented:
1. **Column Drop:** Single column on mobile, multiple columns on desktop
2. **Off-Canvas Navigation:** Sidebar moves off-screen on mobile
3. **Responsive Typography:** Font sizes adjust based on screen size
4. **Touch-Friendly Interactions:** Larger touch targets on mobile
5. **Conditional Rendering:** Some elements only appear on larger screens

### Testing Recommendations

To ensure proper responsive behavior:
1. Test on actual devices, not just browser resizing
2. Test on low-end devices to ensure performance
3. Test with touch input for mobile interactions
4. Use device emulation in Chrome DevTools
5. Test orientation changes (portrait vs landscape)

## Usage Examples

### Using the Responsive Hook

```jsx
import useResponsive from '@/lib/hooks/useResponsive';

function MyComponent() {
  const { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop } = useResponsive();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isMobile && <MobileView />}
      {isTablet && <TabletView />}
      {isDesktop && <DesktopView />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using ResponsiveContainer

```jsx
import ResponsiveContainer from '@/components/layout/ResponsiveContainer';

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ResponsiveContainer>
      <h1>My Content</h1>
      <p>This will have proper responsive margins and max-width.</p>
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  );
}
```

### Using ResponsiveGrid

```jsx
import ResponsiveGrid from '@/components/layout/ResponsiveGrid';

function FeatureList() {
  return (
    <ResponsiveGrid 
      columns={{ default: 1, sm: 2, lg: 3 }}
      gap={{ default: 4, md: 6 }}
    >
      <FeatureCard />
      <FeatureCard />
      <FeatureCard />
    </ResponsiveGrid>
  );
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Images use proper `sizes` attributes for responsive loading
- Components conditionally render based on screen size
- CSS utility classes are used to minimize custom CSS
- Responsive components are client-side with proper hydration handling
