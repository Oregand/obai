# Production Readiness Improvements

This document tracks the improvements made to make the OBAI application production-ready.

## 1. API Rate Limiting

Rate limiting has been implemented via a Next.js middleware to protect API endpoints from abuse.

### Features:
- Different limits for authenticated and anonymous users
- 50 requests per minute for anonymous users
- 200 requests per minute for authenticated users
- Proper rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
- 429 Too Many Requests response when limit is exceeded
- Information about when the rate limit will reset

### Implementation:
- File: `/middleware.ts`
- Tests: `/__tests__/middleware.test.ts`

### Production Considerations:
- For production, consider using Redis or another distributed store instead of in-memory maps
- Adjust rate limits based on actual usage patterns
- Monitor rate limit hits to detect potential abuse

## 2. Improved Test Coverage

Added tests for critical authentication flows:

### Authentication Tests:
- NextAuth configuration tests
- Credentials provider authorization logic
- Session and JWT callback functions

### Registration API Tests:
- Input validation
- Existing user detection
- User creation flow
- Error handling

### Implementation:
- Files: 
  - `/__tests__/api/auth/auth.test.ts`
  - `/__tests__/api/auth/register.test.ts`

### Next Steps for Testing:
1. Continue adding tests for other critical paths:
   - Chat functionality
   - Payment processing
   - User profile management
2. Add API integration tests
3. Set up end-to-end tests with Cypress
4. Consider setting up test data factories

## 3. Security Headers

Implemented security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

### Headers Implemented:
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Controls which resources can be loaded
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by controlling iframe usage
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information in requests
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features (formerly Feature-Policy)
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections

### Implementation:
- File: `/next.config.js` - Using Next.js headers() configuration
- File: `/pages/_document.tsx` - Additional security meta tags

### CSP Directives:
- **default-src**: Restricts all fetches to same origin
- **script-src**: Allows scripts from same origin and CDNs
- **img-src**: Allows images from specific trusted domains
- **connect-src**: Allows connections to API endpoints
- Additional directives to restrict other content types

### Production Considerations:
- Regularly review and update CSP directives as application needs change
- Consider implementing a report-only CSP initially to detect issues
- Use a security headers scanner (like securityheaders.com) to verify configuration

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific tests
npm test -- auth.test.ts
```

## Vercel Deployment Setup

To ensure security headers are properly applied when deploying to Vercel:

1. Vercel automatically detects and applies Next.js configurations
2. No additional setup required for security headers in `next.config.js`
3. Verify headers after deployment using a tool like securityheaders.com

## Additional Production Readiness Steps to Consider

1. **Error Monitoring**
   - Integrate with Sentry or similar error tracking service

2. **Logging Strategy**
   - Implement structured logging
   - Set up log aggregation

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

4. **Docker Configuration**
   - Containerize the application for consistent environments

5. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
   - Implement stricter CORS policies for API routes
