# Bug Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address several errors in the application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing AutoTopupSettings Table

**Error:**
```
The table `public.AutoTopupSettings` does not exist in the current database.
```

**Solution:**
Run the Prisma migration to create the missing table. The `AutoTopupSettings` model is already defined in the schema.prisma file but needs to be migrated to the database.

```bash
cd prisma
chmod +x run-migrations.sh
./run-migrations.sh
```

### 2. Missing `isFreeMessage` Field in Message Model

**Error:**
```
Unknown argument `isFreeMessage`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

**Solution:**
The `isFreeMessage` field is defined in the Prisma schema but wasn't properly migrated to the database. The migration script will fix this issue.

### 3. Missing AI Service Module

**Error:**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/services/ai-service'
```

**Solution:**
Created the missing AI service file at `/lib/services/ai-service.ts` with a basic implementation of the `generateResponse` function.

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the Prisma migration to update the database schema:
   ```bash
   cd prisma
   chmod +x run-migrations.sh
   ./run-migrations.sh
   ```

2. Restart your Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The AI service implementation is a placeholder that returns simulated responses. In a production environment, you would connect to a real AI provider.
- The `isFreeMessage` check in the `token-service.ts` file has been temporarily modified to work with the current database schema. After migration, you can revert to using `isFreeMessage: true` in the query.
- The types directory has been added with basic types for the application.

## Next Steps

After applying these fixes and confirming the application is working correctly, you should:

1. Review the AI service implementation and replace it with a connection to your preferred AI provider.
2. Update the token tracking and free message logic to use the appropriate business rules.
3. Consider adding proper error handling and monitoring for the payment and subscription systems.
